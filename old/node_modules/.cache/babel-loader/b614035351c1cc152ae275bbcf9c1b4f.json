Additionally, I completed a semester-long group project resulting\n                in the mobile and web version of Mood-Tracking App, also in JavaScript and React, complete with features such \n                as a social media feed, chat, daily mood logging, media upload, and more.  Through this course, I gained hands-on web\n                and mobile app development experience, and practiced the entire development cycle from early design stages to depoloyment.\n              </p>\n              <br/>\n              <div style={{display: \"flex\", padding: \"5px\", justifyContent: \"space-between\"}}> \n                <a \n                  style={{textDecoration: \"none\"}}\n                  className=\"button-dark\" \n                  href=\"http://calm-beach-22652.herokuapp.com/\" \n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                >\n                  Click here to play \"Guess Who\".\n                </a>\n                <a \n                  style={{textDecoration: \"none\"}}\n                  className=\"button-dark\" \n                  href=\"http://calm-beach-22652.herokuapp.com/\" \n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                >\n                  Click here to view Cloud9 on GitHub.\n                </a>\n                <br/>\n              </div>\n              <br />\n            </div>\n            <br/>\n\n            <div className=\"solid-text\" style={{width: \"90%\"}}>\n              <h3 className=\"subtitle\">Institute for Human Machine Cognition</h3>\n              <br/>\n              <p className=\"text\">\n              As a research intern, I designed, coded, and conducted a survey to ollect data \n              related to how participants perceive credibility of tweets related to COVID-19.  \n              I first wrote a python script to extract relevant tweets from over 400 Twitter \n              users, then built the survey using HTML, CSS, and PHP.
