Through this course, I learned how to apply theory to real-world problems, and, though challenging,\n                further excited my passion for computer science, as I first began to see how code could interact with the real world.\n              </p>\n              <br/>\n            </div>\n            <br/> */}\n\n            <div className=\"solid-text\" style={{width: \"90%\"}}>\n              <h3 className=\"subtitle\">Software Design/Engineering</h3>\n              <br/>\n              <p className=\"text\">\n                This course explored the full software development process from design to front end, to back end, to testing\n                and refactoring.  Applying common practices in software engineering, such as AGILE project management, this\n                course's homeworks culminated in the design and implementation of both a mobile and web version of a \"Guess \n                The Celebrity\" game in Javascript and React.  Additionally, I completed a semester-long group project resulting\n                in the mobile and web version of Mood-Tracking App, also in JavaScript and React, complete with features such \n                as a social media feed, chat, daily mood logging, media upload, and more.  Through this course, I gained hands-on web\n                and mobile app development experience, and practiced the entire development cycle from early design stages to depoloyment.\n              </p>\n              <br/>\n              <div style={{display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"space-between\", width: \"80%\", margin: \"auto\"}}> \n                <a \n                  style={{textDecoration: \"none\"}}\n                  className=\"button-dark\" \n                  href=\"http://calm-beach-22652.herokuapp.com/\" \n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                >\n                  Click here to play \"Guess Who\".\n                </a>\n                <a \n                  style={{textDecoration: \"none\"}}\n                  className=\"button-dark\" \n                  href=\"https://github.com/cis350/mood-tracker-team28\" \n                  target=\"_blank\"\n                >\n                  Click here to view Cloud9 on GitHub.\n                </a>\n                <br/>\n              </div>\n              <br />\n            </div>\n            <br/>\n\n            <div className=\"solid-text\" style={{width: \"90%\"}}>\n              <h3 className=\"subtitle\">Brain Science for Business</h3>\n              <br/>\n              <p className=\"text\">\n                This course explored various neuromarketing techniques and how they impact business, education,\n                ethics, policy, etc. This course culminated in a class team competition, where each week two teams\n                would present give a one-minute pitch of a startup of their creation, while the other teams chose\n                how much \\\"PlattBucks\\\" they wanted to invest.
